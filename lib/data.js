      'I suppose this website mostly speaks for itself. I built this website over the course of a few days from scratch. Over my professional career I have developed a design cycle that I use in both digital and physical design projects. \n •  First, I start by defining the high level goals of my project; in this case, effectively display my passion and mastery of front end development and design. \n •  Second, I compile a moodboard of images that best represent the mood and feel of my eventual design; I do not limit myself purely to images of websites, but also include images of physical products, art, and other media. Inspiration should come from everywhere. \n •  Third, once I have a solid moodboard, I begin to sketch out my design ideas on paper. I love dotted graph paper, hence the background of this website, it reminds me of my grandfather for some reason.  \n •  Fourth, Depending on the scope of the design, I will either wireframe the project in Adobe XD or Figma or I will begin coding if I feel that my moodboard and sketches are sufficent to guide me when I become stuck or confused. \n I have found this process cycle to be very effective in helping me to create designs that are both functional and beautiful. I have also developed a working model for this process that I have used to help teams develop their own brand idenity, whether the members are designers or not.',

The problem is, hitting that goal with the resources on hand can require extremely complex calculations. \n Diet Tuner is a tool that allows farmers take a prescribed diet for a cow and formulate that diet as closely as possible with the resources on hand. \n I was responsible for building a standalone application for the Diet Tuner front end.
